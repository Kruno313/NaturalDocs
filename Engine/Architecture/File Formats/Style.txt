	Topic: Inhert

		> Inherit: [style]

		States that this style inherits the specified style, meaning the inherited style's files will be included in the
		output first, then this style's files.  Can be specified multiple times.


	Topic: Onload

		> OnLoad: [code]
		> Frame OnLoad: [code]
		> Content OnLoad: [code]
		> Home OnLoad: [code]

		Specifies a single line of JavaScript code that will be executed from the page's OnLoad function.  Can be restricted
		to certain page types or applied to all of them.  If you have a non-trivial amount of code to run you should define
		a function to be called from here instead.

		OnLoad values can contain "$Locale{identifier}" strings, where the identifier is one from the Engine.NaturalDocs
		locale file ([ND Dir]/Translations/NaturalDocs.Engine.[locale].txt).  It will be replaced with the value from that file,
		allowing substitutions from the user's native language.


	Topic: Link

		> Link: [file]
		> Frame Link: [file]
		> Content Link: [file]
		> Home Link: [file]

		Specifies a .css, .js, or .json file that should be included in the page output, such as with a script or link tag.
		JavaScript files can be restricted to certain page types or linked to all of them.  CSS files can only be linked to all
		of them.  The file path is relative to the style's folder.

		All files found in the style's folder are not automatically included because some may be intended to be loaded
		dynamically, or the .css files may already be linked together with @import.


	Topic: Home Page

		> Home Page: [file]

		Specifies a .html file to serve as the home page.  If it's defined none of the OnLoad or Link properties will have any
		effect on it.  Equivalent properties must be manually added to the HTML file if they're needed.  If a home page isn't
		defined then default one will be generated.

		The home page HTML file may contain these values which will be replaced by their corresponding properties in the
		project info:

		- %NaturalDocs_Title%
		- %NaturalDocs_Subtitle%
		- %NaturalDocs_Copyright%
		- %NaturalDocs_Timestamp%

		Entity subsitutions will be made for <, >, and " so they are safe to embed directly in the HTML or in double-quoted
		JavaScript strings.
