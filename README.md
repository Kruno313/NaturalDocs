# Natural Docs

Natural Docs is an open source documentation generator for 
[multiple programming languages](https://www.naturaldocs.org/languages).  You document your code in a 
[natural syntax](https://www.naturaldocs.org/features/comments) that reads like plain English.  Natural Docs then scans 
your code and builds [high-quality HTML documentation](https://www.naturaldocs.org/features/output) from it.
